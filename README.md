# :fire:Features
* It can do a lot of cool things, some of them being:<br>
* With the help of this you can compare two courses, and findout which one is longer.<br>
* For a content creator it is helpful to check his playlist's total duration and findout which one is longest playlist.<br>
* It show the duration in **_HH:MM:SS_** format.<br>

# :mag_right:**_How to find a palylist's id ?_**
> Go to playlist and copy the link of playlist.<br>
> Pick the text which is after the **"_list=_"** in link.<br>
> Eg: Playlist Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0&list=PLMC9KNkIncKvYin_USF1qoJQnIyMAfRxl<br>
> Then Playlist Id would be: **_PLMC9KNkIncKvYin_USF1qoJQnIyMAfRxl_**<br>
